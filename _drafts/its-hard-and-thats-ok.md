Let's be clear.  I love [Mr Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com).  He's probably one of the most important financial authors in history in my opionion, so please don't take any of this as a personal assault to Pete or his message.  He's fighting the good fight and I commend him for it.

When I first found Mr Money Mustache, I was already doing pretty well with saving for retirement, but didn't really realize it.  While I was pouring through his blog, I really felt like he was talking directly to me.

* Highly paid software engineer?  **Check**.
* Early thirties?  **Check**.
* Reasonable spending habits?  **Check**.

Holy shit, I can actually retire early!  I didn't even know that was an option!

That was around 5 years ago.  I don't remember exactly how much money I had saved at that point, but it was really good by normal standards for only being 32.  I had maybe around 180K saved up between all my accounts and had a decent chunk knocked out of my mortgage.

So I became obsessed.  I maxed out my wife's 401K, maxed out two roth IRAs, saved a ton in a taxable account.  All the stuff you're supposed to do when you find the FIRE community.  I complained when we went out to eat, but still really enjoyed going out to eat.  I bitched and moaned when we bought "stuff".  But of course only when my wife bought stuff, the stuff I bought was ok.  We still took vacations, but sometimes I had a hard time enjoying them because of the money we spent.

So now here we are, 5 years later, and we have nearly half a million dollars saved and we only owe 100K on our house.  So we're doing awesome, but I'm not happy.  In fact, I'm exhausted.

Why?  Because saving for early retirement is fucking hard if you push yourself too hard and give yourself an unrealistic timeline.  I've had tunnel vision for five years just focusing on retiring early.  For what?  And at what cost?

Mr Money Mustache never really talks about the "grind" that it takes to get to where he is now.  It's basically summed up as "Oh, just save 75% of your money for 10 years while you're working".  That's a true statement, but I think it's also a bit like telling a person who's struggled with their weight there whole lives to "Just eat less".  MMM brain is wired differently than most "normal" people, and he's admitted that many times on his blog.  [The Mad Fientist](https://www.madfientist.com) wrote a very similiar [post](https://www.madfientist.com/happiness-through-subtraction/) about what I feel like I'm going through.  Striving for early retirement, even for someone like The Mad Fientist, can cause depression, anxiety, and a general sense of darkness if you're not careful.

I've always excelled in nearly everything I've put my mind to.  In school I was always top of the class, in work I was always the best programmer, and in life I always had more money saved than everyone else.  But I've never really been able to take a step back and be proud of my accomplishments, and I think that is a common problem with overachievers.

I told my wife the other night I felt like I was in mile 20 of a marathon and was running out of steam.  The last 6 miles are harder than the first 20.  We're ALMOST there, and I'm beating myself up for not already living that fabled Mustachian lifestyle of sleeping in as late as I want, riding a bike around town and drinking micro-brews all day with all my other early retired buddies.

This tweet from J.D. Roth, one of the OG's of Internet personal finance, sums it up

Be you, and be proud of you.  I've got lots to be proud of.  We're not FIRE yet, and may never be, but we've got a decent financial base.  I've got an awesome wife, sweet kids and I'm a great dad, and that means more than any number in a bank account ever will.

So don't be discouraged. Early retirement, and life in general, is not as easy as the Internet makes it out to be.  Don't be so hard on yourself like I was, and be proud of your accomplishments and enjoy the ride.

I'm still going to do my best to retire early, but not at the expense of my happiness.  I'm going to still save agressively but I'm also going to allow myself to enjoy life.  Hey, I even signed up for a wine of the month club, and I suggest you do the same :)
